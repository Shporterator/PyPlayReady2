# PyPlayReady

**Modules for PlayReady DRM based on MSPR_TOOLKIT**

`PyPlayReady` is a Python-based framework designed to manage Microsoft PlayReady Digital Rights Management (DRM) protocols, derived from components of the `MSPR_TOOLKIT`. While the project offers essential PlayReady DRM features, it is not a complete implementation. Some modules are incomplete or may not function as expected.

## Project Scope and Limitations

The repository provides essential components for handling cryptographic operations, XML-based DRM requests, content decryption, and metadata management. **Note**: This is a work-in-progress, and additional refinements are necessary to achieve full functionality.

### Current Limitations

- **Core DRM Mechanisms**: Covers basic DRM operations but lacks some advanced PlayReady features, such as full license chain validation and device-specific restrictions.
- **Potential Bugs**: Known limitations in cryptographic key handling, XML parsing, and error handling. Certain modules require enhanced error management for data integrity and object serialization.
- **Incomplete Implementations**: Partial implementations and stubs are provided for some functions, such as encryption key handling, integrity checks, and cryptographic verification.

## Known Issues

- **Cryptographic Key Parsing**: Needs alignment with PlayReady standards for key data and length.
- **Content Protection Header Parsing**: XML content headers may need validation and additional fields for PlayReady compliance.
- **Incomplete Error Handling**: Some error cases currently lead to undefined behavior or incomplete responses.

## Contribution

We welcome contributors to improve `PyPlayReady`. If you encounter issues, please submit them, and consider contributing with pull requests to enhance this project.
